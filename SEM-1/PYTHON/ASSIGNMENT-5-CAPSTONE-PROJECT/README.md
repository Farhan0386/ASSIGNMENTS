## 📊 Input Data Format

### CSV Requirements
Each CSV file in the `data/` directory should contain:
- `Timestamp`: Date and time of measurement
- `Building`: Building name (e.g., "Library", "Engineering")
- `kWh`: Energy consumption in kilowatt-hours

### Sample CSV Structure
```csv
Timestamp,Building,kWh
2024-11-01 00:00:00,Library,45.2
2024-11-01 01:00:00,Library,43.8
2024-11-01 02:00:00,Library,42.1
```

The generated `dashboard.png` contains four comprehensive panels:

### Panel 1: Daily Campus Energy Consumption
- **Type:** Line chart
- **Shows:** Total campus energy consumption per day
- **Purpose:** Identify daily trends and patterns

### Panel 2: Average Weekly Usage by Building
- **Type:** Bar chart
- **Shows:** Average weekly consumption for each building
- **Purpose:** Compare building efficiency

### Panel 3: Peak Hour vs Peak kWh
- **Type:** Scatter plot with annotations

## 🧠 Architecture

### Object-Oriented Design

#### `BuildingManager` Class
Central class managing all energy data operations.

**Attributes:**
- `df`: Combined DataFrame with all building data
- `summary_stats`: Statistical summary per building
- `daily_totals`: Daily campus-wide totals
- `weekly_avg_by_building`: Weekly averages per building
- `peak_hours_by_building`: Peak consumption times

**Methods:**
```python
calculate_summary_statistics() -> pd.DataFrame
calculate_time_trends() -> tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]
generate_dashboard_plots(output_path) -> Path
export_results(output_path) -> Path
```

---

## 📊 Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Data Ingestion
```python
def ingest_data(data_dir: Path) -> pd.DataFrame
```
- Scans `data/` directory for CSV files
- Validates column structure
- Handles malformed rows with `on_bad_lines='skip'`
- Converts timestamps to datetime
- Combines all files into single DataFrame

### 2. Statistical Analysis
```python
calculate_summary_statistics()
```
**Generates:**
- `mean_kWh`: Average consumption
- `min_kWh`: Minimum consumption
- `max_kWh`: Maximum consumption
- `total_kWh`: Total consumption

### 3. Trend Analysis
```python
calculate_time_trends()
```
**Produces:**
- Daily campus totals using `resample('D')`
- Weekly averages per building
- Peak hour identification

### 4. Visualization
```python
generate_dashboard_plots()
```
**Creates:**
- Multi-panel matplotlib figure
- Professional styling
- High-resolution PNG (150 DPI)

### 5. Export & Reporting
```python
export_results()
```
**Outputs:**
- CSV with building statistics
- Console executive summary

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Validation
- Checks for required columns (`Timestamp`, `Building`, `kWh`)
- Skips malformed CSV rows
- Converts data types with error handling
- Removes rows with missing critical data

### Time-Series Processing
- **Timestamp Indexing:** Sets datetime as DataFrame index
- **Resampling Frequencies:**
  - `'D'`: Daily aggregation
  - `'W'`: Weekly aggregation
- **Aggregation Functions:** `sum()`, `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`

### Peak Detection
```python
# Identifies hour and value of maximum consumption per building
df_with_hour = df.copy()
df_with_hour['Hour'] = df.index.hour
peak_hours = df.groupby('Building').apply(
    lambda g: g.loc[g['kWh'].idxmax()][['Hour', 'kWh']]
)
```
